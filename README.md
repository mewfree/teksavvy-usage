# teksavvy-usage
Simple Python script to get your TekSavvy (Canadian ISP) data usage. You have to edit the file and provide your own API key and data cap.

I was inspired by https://gist.github.com/tessus/967c9b903e58d974907d and ported it to Python3 (hence the 3 in the filename) using requests.

There are other solutions available on GitHub but this is the simpler and most readable one (~15 lines of code).
